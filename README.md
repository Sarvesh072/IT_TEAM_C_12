# Stock_Trading_bot_mark1
An Automated Stock Trading Bot using python
Here are some key components of the script:

Environment Setup:

Alpaca API credentials are provided to connect to the Alpaca trading platform.
An environment class (StockTradingEnv) is assumed to be defined for stock trading.
Neural Network Models:

Actor and Critic networks are defined using TensorFlow's Keras API. The actor represents the policy, and the critic evaluates the value function.
The networks use dense layers with ReLU activation for the actor and critic.
PPO Memory:

The PPOMemory class is defined to store experiences and generate batches for training.
Agent Class:

The Agent class uses PPO for training the actor and critic networks.
The choose_action method selects actions based on the actor's output.
The learn method updates the networks using the PPO algorithm.
Training Loop:

The script includes a training loop where the agent interacts with the environment, makes trading decisions, and learns from experiences.
TensorBoard is set up for tracking and visualizing training progress.
The script saves the models when an improvement in the average score is observed.
Alpaca API Interaction:

Trading actions (buy/sell orders) are submitted using the Alpaca API based on the agent's decisions.
Learning and Logging:

The learning process is logged, and the script prints episode information, scores, and time steps.
Plotting:

There is a reference to a plot_learning_curve function, but its implementation is not provided in the script.
Before running this script, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Alpaca API, TensorFlow, and others. Additionally, you may want to customize certain parameters such as API keys, stock symbol, training parameters, and environment setup based on your specific requirements.
